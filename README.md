## Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Feedback**
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides real-time feedback on speech delivery, including aspects such as tone, pace, volume, and clarity.
- **Body Language Evaluation**: Using the device's camera, Orator AI evaluates posture, gestures, eye contact, and non-verbal cues.

### 2. **Split-App Architecture**
Orator AI employs a **split-app model** that leverages Google Firebase services for cloud-based operations, while core AI processing happens on-device. Key components include:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and account management with Google authentication integration.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage**: Secure storage of user data and practice sessions with cloud synchronization and backup.
- **Firebase Remote Config**: Allows dynamic updates of AI models and app configurations without requiring full app updates.
- **Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics**: Monitors app performance and usage patterns to continuously improve user experience.

### 3. **Multi-User Support**
- **Personalized Profiles**: Each user has their own profile with individualized settings, practice history, progress tracking, and preferences.
- **Data Isolation**: Secure and private handling of user data, ensuring data isolation across accounts.
- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Seamless access to personal profiles across multiple devices via cloud sync.

### 4. **Sensor Integration**
Orator AI leverages several device sensors to enhance user feedback:
- **Camera**: Captures video for body language analysis.
- **Microphone**: Records audio for feedback on verbal communication, such as tone, pace, volume, and filler words.
- **Accelerometer/Gyroscope (Optional)**: Enhances detection of movements and provides more accurate feedback on posture and gestures.

### 5. **Offline Functionality**
Orator AI remains fully functional even without internet connectivity:
- **Practice Sessions**: Users can continue recording speeches and receive real-time feedback offline.
- **Feedback and Resources**: On-device AI models provide instant feedback, and previously downloaded resources (such as tutorials) are available offline.
- **Data Sync**: When reconnected to the internet, the app automatically syncs data and updates profiles.
